# ✨ Why “30” Questions?

### In Persian culture, the number 30 is more than just a number it symbolizes endurance, wisdom, and completeness that emerges from diversity and time:

**🏛️ In Naqsh-e Rostam**: 30 nations with different garments stand beside the tomb of Darius a symbol of unity in diversity.  
**📖 In Kalila and Dimna**: 30 parables shaped the wisdom of kings and scholars each a window into politics and philosophy.  
**🪶 Ferdowsi devoted 30 years of his life** to writing the Shahnameh the number became a sign of conscious struggle and cultural immortality.  
**🕊️ The “Simorgh” in Persian literature** is revealed as the 30 birds themselves a metaphor for inner growth, unity, and self-realization.  
**🗓️ The Zoroastrian calendar**: with its 12 months of 30 days, reflects cosmic order and scientific precision in ancient Iranian thought.

# 🎯 What is this project and why does it exist?

In a world filled with shallow tutorials, this project is an invitation to deep understanding.

Each topic is represented by **30 fundamental, conceptual, and discussion-worthy questions** not questions about syntax or variable types, but ones that push us to explore:

- Why?
- When?
- How?
- And what design choices lie underneath?

# 🧠 The Goal

This project is simultaneously:

✅ A structured learning resource for **deep understanding in minimal time**  
✅ A useful reference for both **interviewers and interviewees**  
✅ And a space for **technical dialogue, comparisons, and experience sharing**

# 🌀 What makes this project different?

You’re not just expected to “know what something is” you’re encouraged to **understand why it exists**, **how it compares to alternatives**, and **what decisions shaped it**.  
Each question is a **mental knot**, and each answer a **clear, honest analysis**.

If you have a better answer or a different perspective join the conversation. This project is designed to grow through many minds.
